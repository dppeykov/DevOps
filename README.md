DevOps Interview Questions 👨🏻‍💻
===============================

**1. Define DevOps and what does it mean to you?**

> DevOps is a culture and a way of thinking, it is not a particular tool or set of tools. A good way to think of DevOps is through the CAMS principle:

> **CAMS** = **C**ulture, **A**utomation, **M**easurements, **S**haring 
>  - __Culture:__ result of the way teams interact. In DevOps the operations (sys admins) and the developement teams are working closely toghether towards a common goal;
>  - __Automation:__ used to speed up the feedback between teams by using tools that allow collaboration and repeatable processes. Examples are tools for revision control (version control = git), continuous integration (Jenkins, GitLab, CircleCI ...) and configuration management (Chef, Ansible, Puppet ...);
>  - __Measurement:__ used to track the progress/improvements. Helps finding bottlenecks and degradations during deployment;
>  - __Sharing:__ allows for exchanging of ideas, problems and solutions between the teams. Contributes to the transparency of thoughts and the open culture of the teams/company;


**2. Can you describe the DevOps LifeCycle?**

> The DevOps lifecycle consists of **8 stages** in a constant loop. The first 4 activities (plan, code, build, test) are focused more on the development processes and teams, while the other 4 (release, deploy, operate, monitor) - on the operations.

**3. What are the differences between Lean, Agile and DevOps?**

>**Lean** - an approach to software development focused on optimizing development resources with the initial goal of delivering MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Once the MVP is released to the market, the development team takes feedback and makes adjustments (adds/removes/improves) to the software product based on the customer's requests. 
> **Agile** - a framework for multiple approaches for software development, most commonly of which is the SCRUM approach.
> - **SCRUM** uses 2 weeks periods for application development, called __sprints__. During each sprint the development team uses input from the business (**feedback cycle**) to add specific features and/or repair bugs. at the end of the sprint a **new version** of the application is released.
