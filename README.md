DevOps Interview Questions 👨🏻‍💻
===============================

### **1. Define DevOps and what does it mean to you?**

> DevOps is a culture and a way of thinking, it is not a particular tool or set of tools. a good way to think of DevOps is through the CAMS principle:

> **CAMS** = **C**ulture, **A**utomation, **M**easurements, **S**haring 
>  - __Culture:__ result of the way teams interact. In DevOps the operations (sys admins) and the developement teams are working closely toghether towards a common goal;
>  - __Automation:__ used to speed up the feedback between teams by using tools that allow collaboration and repeatable processes. Examples are tools for revision control (version control = git), continuous integration (Jenkins, GitLab, CircleCI ...) and configuration management (Chef, Ansible, Puppet ...);
>  - __Measurement:__ used to track the progress/improvements. Helps finding bottlenecks and degradations during deployment;
>  - __Sharing:__ allows for exchanging of ideas, problems and solutions between the teams. Contributes to the transparency of thoughts and the open culture of the teams/company;
